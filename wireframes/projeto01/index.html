             <p>Don't you ever say I just walked away. I will always want you! I can't live a lie, running for my life, i will always want you! I came in like a wrecking ball, i never hit so hard in love. All I wanted was to break your walls, all you ever did was break me, Yeah you, you wreck me!</p>

             <h1>I put you high up in the sky</h1>
             <p>And now, you're not coming down. It slowly turned, you let me burn and now, we're ashes on the ground. 
Don't you ever say I just walked away, I will always want you! I can't live a lie, running for my life, i will always want you!</p>

             <h1>I never meant to start a war</h1>
             <p>I just wanted you to let me in and instead of using force, I guess I should've let you in. I never meant to start a war, I just wanted you to let me in â€¦ I guess I should've let you win. Don't you ever say I just walked away,
I will always want you!</p>
